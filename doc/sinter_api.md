            python interpreter is stopped or killed, calling this method again

        hint_num_tasks: If `tasks` is an iterator or a generator, its length
            can be given here so that progress printouts can say how many cases
            are left.
        decoders: Defaults to None (specified by each Task). The names of the
            decoders to use on each Task. It must either be the case that each
            Task specifies a decoder and this is set to None, or this is an
            iterable and each Task has its decoder set to None.
        count_observable_error_combos: Defaults to False. When set to to True,
            the returned stats will have a custom counts field with keys
            like `obs_mistake_mask=E_E__` counting how many times specific
            combinations of observables were mispredicted by the decoder.
        count_detection_events: Defaults to False. When set to True, the
            returned stats will have a custom counts field withs the
            key `detection_events` counting the number of times a detector fired
            and also `detectors_checked` counting the number of detectors that
            were executed. The detection fraction is the ratio of these two
            numbers.
        max_shots: Defaults to None (unused). Stops the sampling process
            after this many samples have been taken from the circuit.
        max_errors: Defaults to None (unused). Stops the sampling process
            after this many errors have been seen in samples taken from the
            circuit. The actual number sampled errors may be larger due to
            batching.
        start_batch_size: Defaults to None (collector's choice). The very
            first shots taken from the circuit will use a batch of this
            size, and no other batches will be taken in parallel. Once this
            initial fact finding batch is done, batches can be taken in
            parallel and the normal batch size limiting processes take over.
        max_batch_size: Defaults to None (unused). Limits batches from
            taking more than this many shots at once. For example, this can
            be used to ensure memory usage stays below some limit.
        print_progress: When True, progress is printed to stderr while
            collection runs.
        max_batch_seconds: Defaults to None (unused). When set, the recorded
            data from previous shots is used to estimate how much time is
            taken per shot. This information is then used to predict the
            biggest batch size that can finish in under the given number of
            seconds. Limits each batch to be no larger than that.
        custom_decoders: Named child classes of `sinter.decoder`, that can be
            used if requested by name by a task or by the decoders list.
            If not specified, only decoders with support built into sinter, such
            as 'pymatching' and 'fusion_blossom', can be used.
        custom_error_count_key: Makes `max_errors` apply to `stat.custom_counts[key]`
            instead of `stat.errors`.
        allowed_cpu_affinity_ids: Controls which CPUs the workers can be pinned to. The
            set of allowed IDs should be at least as large as the number of workers, though
            this is not strictly required. If not set, defaults to all CPUs being allowed.

    Returns:
        A list of sample statistics, one from each problem. The list is not in
        any specific order. This is the same data that would have been written
        to a CSV file, but aggregated so that each problem has exactly one

    explicitly set to None), a default batch-size-limiting mechanism will be
    chosen.

    Args:
        num_workers: The number of worker processes to use.
        tasks: Decoding problems to sample.
        hint_num_tasks: If `tasks` is an iterator or a generator, its length
            can be given here so that progress printouts can say how many cases
            are left.
        additional_existing_data: Defaults to None (no additional data).
            Statistical data that has already been collected, in addition to
            anything included in each task's `previous_stats` field.
        decoders: Defaults to None (specified by each Task). The names of the
            decoders to use on each Task. It must either be the case that each
            Task specifies a decoder and this is set to None, or this is an
            iterable and each Task has its decoder set to None.
        max_shots: Defaults to None (unused). Stops the sampling process
            after this many samples have been taken from the circuit.
        max_errors: Defaults to None (unused). Stops the sampling process
            after this many errors have been seen in samples taken from the
            circuit. The actual number sampled errors may be larger due to
            batching.
        count_observable_error_combos: Defaults to False. When set to to True,
            the returned stats will have a custom counts field with keys
            like `obs_mistake_mask=E_E__` counting how many times specific
            combinations of observables were mispredicted by the decoder.
        count_detection_events: Defaults to False. When set to True, the
            returned stats will have a custom counts field withs the
            key `detection_events` counting the number of times a detector fired
            and also `detectors_checked` counting the number of detectors that
            were executed. The detection fraction is the ratio of these two
            numbers.
        start_batch_size: Defaults to None (collector's choice). The very
            first shots taken from the circuit will use a batch of this
            size, and no other batches will be taken in parallel. Once this
            initial fact finding batch is done, batches can be taken in
            parallel and the normal batch size limiting processes take over.
        max_batch_size: Defaults to None (unused). Limits batches from
            taking more than this many shots at once. For example, this can
            be used to ensure memory usage stays below some limit.
        max_batch_seconds: Defaults to None (unused). When set, the recorded
            data from previous shots is used to estimate how much time is
            taken per shot. This information is then used to predict the
            biggest batch size that can finish in under the given number of
            seconds. Limits each batch to be no larger than that.
        custom_decoders: Custom decoders that can be used if requested by name.
            If not specified, only decoders built into sinter, such as
            'pymatching' and 'fusion_blossom', can be used.
        custom_error_count_key: Makes `max_errors` apply to `stat.custom_counts[key]`
            instead of `stat.errors`.
        allowed_cpu_affinity_ids: Controls which CPUs the workers can be pinned to. The
            set of allowed IDs should be at least as large as the number of workers, though
            this is not strictly required. If not set, defaults to all CPUs being allowed.

    """Approximates the natural log of a binomial distribution's probability.

    When working with large binomials, it's often necessary to work in log space
    to represent the result. For example, suppose that out of two million
    samples 200_000 are hits. The maximum likelihood estimate is p=0.2. Even if
    this is the true probability, the chance of seeing *exactly* 20% hits out of
    a million shots is roughly 10^-217322. Whereas the smallest representable
    double is roughly 10^-324. But ln(10^-217322) ~= -500402.4 is representable.

    This method evaluates $\ln(P(hits = B(n, p)))$, with all computations done
    in log space to ensure intermediate values can be represented as floating
    point numbers without underflowing to 0 or overflowing to infinity. This
    method can be broadcast over multiple hypothesis probabilities by giving a
    numpy array for `p` instead of a single float.

    Args:
        p: The hypotehsis probability. The independent probability of a hit
            occurring for each sample. This can also be an array of
            probabilities, in which case the function is broadcast over the

        n: The number of samples that were taken.
        hits: The number of hits that were observed amongst the samples that
