Two-qubit X basis parity measurement.

This operation measures whether pairs of qubits are in the {|++>,|-->} subspace or in the
{|+->,|-+>} subspace of the two qubit state space. |+> and |-> are the +1 and -1
eigenvectors of the X operator.

If the qubits were in the {|++>,|-->} subspace, False is appended to the measurement record.
If the qubits were in the {|+->,|-+>} subspace, True is appended to the measurement record.
Inverting one of the qubit targets inverts the result.

Parens Arguments:

    If no parens argument is given, the measurement is perfect.
    If one parens argument is given, the measurement result is noisy.
    The argument is the probability of returning the wrong result.

Targets:

    The pairs of qubits to measure in the X basis.

    This operation accepts inverted qubit targets (like `!5` instead of `5`). Inverted
    targets flip the measurement result.

Examples:

    # Measure the +XX observable of qubit 1 vs qubit 2.
    MXX 1 2

    # Measure the -XX observable of qubit 1 vs qubit 2.
    MXX !1 2

    # Measure the +XX observable qubit 1 vs qubit 2, and also qubit 8 vs qubit 9
