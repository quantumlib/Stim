            Creates a measurement sampler for the given circuit.

            The sampler uses a noiseless reference sample, collected from the circuit using
            stim's Tableau simulator during initialization of the sampler, as a baseline for
            deriving more samples using an error propagation simulator.

            Args:
                circuit: The stim circuit to sample from.
                skip_reference_sample: Defaults to False. When set to True, the reference
                    sample used by the sampler is initialized to all-zeroes instead of being
                    collected from the circuit. This means that the results returned by the
                    sampler are actually whether or not each measurement was *flipped*,
                    instead of true measurement results.

                    Forcing an all-zero reference sample is useful when you are only
                    interested in error propagation and don't want to have to deal with the
                    fact that some measurements want to be On when no errors occur. It is
                    also useful when you know for sure that the all-zero result is actually
                    a possible result from the circuit (under noiseless execution), meaning
                    it is a valid reference sample as good as any other. Computing the
                    reference sample is the most time consuming and memory intensive part of
                    simulating the circuit, so promising that the simulator can safely skip
                    that step is an effective optimization.
                seed: PARTIALLY determines simulation results by deterministically seeding
                    the random number generator.

                    Must be None or an integer in range(2**64).

                    Defaults to None. When None, the prng is seeded from system entropy.

                    When set to an integer, making the exact same series calls on the exact
                    same machine with the exact same version of Stim will produce the exact
                    same simulation results.

                    CAUTION: simulation results *WILL NOT* be consistent between versions of
                    Stim. This restriction is present to make it possible to have future
                    optimizations to the random sampling, and is enforced by introducing
                    intentional differences in the seeding strategy from version to version.

                    CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent across machines that
                    differ in the width of supported SIMD instructions. For example, using
                    the same seed on a machine that supports AVX instructions and one that
                    only supports SSE instructions may produce different simulation results.

                    CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent if you vary how many
                    shots are taken. For example, taking 10 shots and then 90 shots will
                    give different results from taking 100 shots in one call.
