/// This class is responsible for iterating backwards over a circuit, tracking which detectors are currently
/// sensitive to an X or Z error on each qubit. This is done by having a SparseXorVec for the X and Z
/// sensitivities of each qubit, and transforming these collections in response to operations.
/// For example, applying a CNOT gate from qubit A to qubit B will xor the X sensitivity of A into B and the
/// Z sensitivity of B into A.
///
/// Y error sensitivity is always implicit in the xor of the X and Z components.
///
/// Note that the class iterates over the circuit *backward*, so that DETECTOR instructions are seen before
/// the measurement operations that the detector depends on. When a DETECTOR is seen, it is noted which
/// measurements it depends on and then when those measurements are seen the detector is added as one of the
/// things sensitive to errors that anticommute with the measurement.
///
/// Be wary that this class is definitely one of the more complex things in Stim. For example:
/// - There is a monobuf that is often used as a temporary buffer to avoid allocations, meaning
///     the state and meaning of the monobuf's tail is highly coupled to what method is currently
///     executing.
/// - The class recursively uses itself when performing period finding on loops. It is seriously
///     hard to directly inspect and understand the current state when period finding is happening
///     inside of period finding.
/// - When period finding succeeds it flushes the recorded errors to avoid crosstalk between the
///     in-loop errors and out-of-loop errors. The state of the buffers is coupled across features.
/// - Error decomposition is done using heuristics that are not guaranteed to work, and prone to
///     being tweaked, creating churn. Also the decomposition code itself is quite complex in order
///     to make it fast (e.g. reducing the explicit detectors into bitmasks and then working with
///     the bitmasks).
/// - I guess what I'm saying is... have fun!
