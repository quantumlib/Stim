The 01 format is a dense human readable format that stores shots as lines of '0' and '1' characters.

The data from each shot is terminated by a newline character '\n'. Each character in the line is a '0' (indicating
False) or a '1' (indicating True) corresponding to a measurement result (or a detector result) from a circuit.

This is the default format used by Stim, because it's the easiest to understand.

The b8 format is a dense binary format that stores shots as bit-packed bytes.

Each shot is stored into ceil(n / 8) bytes, where n is the number of bits in the shot. Effectively, each shot is padded
up to a multiple of 8 by appending False bits, so that shots always start on a byte boundary. Bits are packed into bytes
in significance order (the 1s bit is the first bit, the 2s bit is the second, the 4s bit is the third, and so forth
until the 128s bit which is the eighth bit).

This format requires the reader to know the number of bits in each shot.

            R"HELP(
The ptb64 format is a dense SIMD-focused binary format that stores shots as partially transposed bit-packed data.

Each 64 bit word (8 bytes) of the data contains bits from the same measurement result across 64 separate shots. The next
8 bytes contain bits for the next measurement result from the 64 separate shots. This continues until the 8 bytes
containing the bits from the last measurement result, and then starts over again with data from the next 64 shots (if
there are more).

The shots are stored by byte order then significant order. The first shot's data goes into the least significant bit of
the first byte of each 8 byte group. When the number of shots is not a multiple of 64, the bits corresponding to the
missing shots are always zero.

This format requires the reader to know the number of bits in each shot.
This format requires the reader to know the number of shots that were taken.

This format is generally more tedious to work with, but useful for achieving good performance on data processing tasks
where it is possible to parallelize across shots using SIMD instructions.

The r8 format is a sparse binary format that stores shots as a series of lengths of runs between 1s.

Each byte in the data indicates how many False bits there are before the next True bit. The maximum byte value (255) is
special; it indicates to include 255 False bits but not follow them by a True bit. A shot always has a terminating True
bit appended to it before encoding. Decoding of the shot ends (and the next shot begin) when this True bit just past the
end of the shot data is reached.

This format requires the reader to know the number of bits in each shot.

This format is useful in contexts where the number of set bits is expected to be low, e.g. when sampling detection

The dets format is a sparse human readable format that stores shots as lines starting with the word 'shot'
and then containing space-separated prefixed values like 'D5' and 'L2'. Each value's prefix indicates whether
it is a measurement (M), a detector (D), or observable frame change (L) and its integer indicates that
the corresponding measurement/detection-event/frame-change was True instead of False.

The data from each shot is started with the text 'shot' and terminated by a newline character '\n'. The rest of the
line is a series of integers, separated by spaces and prefixed by a single letter. The prefix letter indicates the type
of value ('M' for measurement, 'D' for detector, and 'L' for logical observable). The integer indicates the index of the
value. For example, "D1 D3 L0" indicates detectors 1 and 3 fired, and logical observable 0 was flipped.

This format requires the reader to know the number of measurements/detectors/observables in each shot, if the reader
wants to produce vectors of bits instead of sets.
