# Stimside Simulator

## tl;dr

Stimside aims to enable classical state transition, tracking and conditioning that can be used to emulate leakage and loss events on top of either the flip simulator or the tableau simulator in Stim. The flip simulator wrapper is called flipside, and the tableau simulator wrapper is called tableside
It's based on and heavily intertwined with Stim and Sinter.
