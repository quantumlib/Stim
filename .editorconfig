# Common editor configurations for this project.         -*- fill-column: 80 -*-
#
# EditorConfig defines a file format for specifying some common coding style
# parameters. Many IDEs and editors read .editorconfig files, either natively
# or via plugins. A few formatters also read .editorconfig; shfmt and Prettier
# are two examples (as of early 2025).
#
# We mostly follow Google's style guides (https://google.github.io/styleguide/)
# except in the case of indentation and line length.
#
# Miscellaneous notes:
#
# - The EditorConfig property `max_line_length` is not set here because its
#   intended behavior is poorly specified. (See the discussion in the comments
#   at https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/issues/387) It *would* have
#   been desirable to define a project convention for the line width here, but
#   we must instead use editor-specific configuration files to do that.
#
# - With few exceptions (e.g., shfmt), `.editorconfig` files are not read by
#   linters or formatters, which means the project needs separate config files
#   for those tools. This includes markdownlint, yamllint, and others.
